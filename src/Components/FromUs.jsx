        The Art Roost Gallery Debuts Art Exhibition “Run Through Walls” From the
        8th to the 9th of April 2023, the Art Roost Gallery will present an
        exhibition of paintings and other forms of art work. This exhibition's
        theme reads “Run Through Walls” which is coined from the English
        idiomatic expression “Run through a Brick wall”. This translates as the
        ability to do whatever it takes to succeed, despite whatever hurdles are
        in one's path. Established in 2021, Art Roost Gallery was founded by
        four friends with a similar interest in Art, Fashion, Creative Design,
        Architecture, and Real Estate. Tochukwu Ugah, Dara Shonubi, Chino
        Okafor, and Mahmud Alabi have come together to shine a light on Art in
        this day and age. As the name suggests “Art Roost” is a form of nest to
        nurture and celebrate artists. It's also an avenue to showcase young
        artists who are striving to be in the art space and also to recognize
        and pay homage to past artists whose artworks make a difference in the
        world. With their first exhibition in the plan, it would also sensitize
        the public on the importance of art and also foster an art community in
        Nigeria. The exhibition would feature known and upcoming artists
        presenting their artworks which gives a glimpse into their artistic
        style, personal stories, and preferences. It would feature artists such
        as Pascal Ugwu and Tobiloba Fasalejo. Born in 1996 in Enugu state,
        Paschal Ugwu resides in Abuja where he creates jaw-dropping artworks.
        Ugwu's art style leans closer to the creation of humans. Ugwu's work is
        a powerful expression of the human form and a thought-provoking
        commentary on the human experience. He has also been featured in
        publications such as "Shoutout Miami", Los Angeles, 2022, and
        "Artmatazz" Art magazine. Tobiloba Fasalejo studies Fine and Applied
        Arts at Obafemi Awolowo University to explore his artistic sense. Right
        from childhood, Tobi has had a liking for art and presently uses his
        artwork as a form to expose and shed light on black identity, in all
        spheres. Both artists have participated in other exhibitions such as a
        group exhibition "In Time like This" by Orange Gallery in Calabar,
        Nigeria.“The Manifesto I & II", at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Library,
        University of Nigeria, Nsukka, 2020. "Dreams Alive 13", at the Marlima
        Basement in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (2018). Their partnership
        with the Art Roost Gallery is to showcase more of their incredible
        artworks and connect with other art enthusiasts in the Lagos art scene
        and it's diaspora.
